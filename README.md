# WaveLink: Neural Synchrony Detection Platform

## Project Overview
WaveLink helps therapists and patients connect better by measuring brain activity alignment, called neural synchrony, using dual-EEG technology. Our SURFER (**S**elf-s**U**pervised co**R**relation **F**eature analyz**ER**) model processes brainwave data to show simple, clear insights on a dashboard on how synchronized two people's brain states are.

This could potentially help therapists adjust in real time, building stronger emotional bonds, reducing stress, and improving outcomes for issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD. WaveLink makes the invisible connection between patient and therapist visible, creating a new way to improve mental health treatment.
